Building
--------

The build system uses a combination of Doxygen and sphynx.  To build, use

    make.bat

This assumes the code has already been built and installed to

    tiff-metadata-extractor/install

It's important to get that install path right so that sphynx's auto-documenting
extensions can find the comments for some files.
